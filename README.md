# csFallingBlocks

This is a clone of a common falling blocks game. I wrote this mostly in 2006 while I was learning to use C and C++. The original project was finished in January of 2007. Also, the original project used the Allegro 4 library. This version has been ported to C#.

## Random Notes

The main engine was written before I took a class on C++. As a consequence of this I did not know how to use pointers, pass by reference, or basic program design. The code for the TetEngine class may seem a little odd due to this. Once I understood these concepts I didn't bother to modify TetEngine because it worked by then.
